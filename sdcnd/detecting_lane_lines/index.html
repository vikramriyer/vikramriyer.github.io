We will work on detecting Lane Lines in this section. Along with that we will also learn about the pipeline that is used for it.
Some of the concepts that will come in handy are:
- Converting image from BGR to GRAY scale for simplycity
- Smoothing or blurring the images to remove spurious areas
- Canny Edge Detection
- Hough Transforms on Lines
- Finding out the region of interest from an entire image/frame
- Weighted sum of images to combine them

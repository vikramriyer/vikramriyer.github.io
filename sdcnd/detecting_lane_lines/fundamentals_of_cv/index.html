            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            We will focus on 2 main techniques in this post
            1. Canny Edge Detection
            2. Hough Transform
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Canny Edge Detection</h4>
            As the name suggests, we use Canny detection to highlight the edges.
            Steps
            1. convert to gray scale
            2. compute the gradients

            Wow, sounds cool and equally scary. Let's break down each of the above steps further, but before we do that, what is an
            edge anyway??
            ((Yaw, daw meme, an edge is an edge which can be used to find edges in a picture with edges))

            ok, so an edge is a partition on an image, where the intensity increases sharply differentiating the parts on the either sides
            of the partition.
            key word: differentiation. Now, we heard this some where, derivatives, gradients and this is precisely the reason why we compute
            gradients. Do not worry if it is not intuitive, we will look at examples and code to understand better.

            However, if you have understood the above function read the below paragraph.
            We mentioned the intensity changing sharply. this is nothing but the change in the image pixels intensities.
            this can be calculated using derivatives or gradients. higher the intensity, higher the gradient. which means it has higher
            chances of qualifying as an edge. remember in the previous post, we talked about how image is just a function and we can
            calculate gradients of functions right?

            give an example using image and ask to find an edge, also take another image where the edge detection might fair using just the canny
            detection algorithm and then mention that we have looked at just one technique and not all problems can be solved using just 1 technique

            ((explain the parameters of the cv2.canny(gray, low_threshold, high_threshold) function))
            gray => the gray image we generated from the original image
            low_threshold => all the values below this will be rejected
            high_threshold => all the values above this will be accepted
            now, the remaining values i.e. between low_threshold and high_threshold will be considered as long as they are connected to strong edges
            for ex: lets say our image is 0-255 ((why 255? => this should give a popping window like on udacity and explain in few words))
            so we set the low_threshold to be 20 and high_threshold to be 200, so all the pixels with intensity values < 20 and > 200 will be
            identified as edge pixels

            gaussian smoothing, used for suppressing noise
            ((no man meme of a black guy))

def main():

            <h4>Hough Transform</h4>
            Now, using the canny algorithm, we have been successfully been able to find the edges, but sometimes, in images like these, ((add image with no specific edges))
            canny will fail as the gradients will be zero due to no change in the intensities. If you look carefully, we can probably understand that this is a ((shape)) and
            if we extrapolate, as a human we do understand it. For the computer, hough transforms will do the same thing. Let's find out how?

            ((Show how canny fails for the example image and how hough wins the race))

            It is a conversion from Image space to Hough space. In the image space we a line is plotted as x vs y and the equation of the line is
            y = mx + b, whereas in hough space, the x vs y can be represented as m vs b. So, the Transform basically is just a conversion from
            image space to hough space.
            y = mx + b => slope and intercept are m and b respectively in the original image space
            b = (-x)m + y => slope and intercept are -x and y in the hough transformed image space

            So, for each point in the image space, we have a line in the hough space.
            ((explanation from the LastMinuteLectures video, with example))

            So, hough transform helps find the shape features like straight lines, circles, etc. We have the edge pixels from above and we plan to fit line to that.
            This is helpful because you may have 1000 edge pixels but you can fit one single line covering all of them which has only 2 parameters,
            m and b. And intuitively we can say that it is more accurate and natural.

            we actually fit a line to the points/edges. hough transform is a method to do just that.

            Now, quickly let us get to know what the parameters actually are in theory. For  beginners, you can skip it for now and come back when you really feel the
            need to know the functions better. For implementation purposes, you can ignore them for now.

            row = ((sign)) = the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line = xcos(theta) + ysin(theta)
            theta = the angle the above line makes with one of the axis
            Now, in the equation of the line, the theta is simply the slope and the row is simply the intercept. :)

            Now, for each of the points in the x,y  plane there are going to be several lines in the m, b or theta, row plane,
            but fortunately for us, there will be a single line that will be getting max number of votes. Let's see how the voting works

            For every x and y, we have series of theta, so, for every edge pixel, there will be a x,y coordinate, we put the values of the x and y
            and get a theta, if the theta has already been voted, vote += 1, finally in the theta, row space, check which theta gets the max no of votes and decide that to be the line

            For people who have understood this far, read below to see why there is a certain point that accumulates most number of votes? Hint: Sinusidal curve
            For an x and y pair, we see that the voting pattern is Sinusidal. When we change the x and y, it originates from a different place, however, is sinusidal as well.
            This way there is a certain point where the all the sinusidal curves tend to meet, this is the point in the theta, row plane which transforms back to a line in the x,y space

            <h4>Concluding lines</h4>
            How is the pipeline of what we discussed?
            image => gray image => canny filter => get edge pixels => hough transform => get lines instead of numerous edge pixels/points

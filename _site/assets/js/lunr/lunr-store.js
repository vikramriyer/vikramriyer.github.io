        "excerpt":"Introduction and What I do, Where I do what I do.  I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Acceldata; the tasks however actually comprises the trio of “Software Engineer, Machine Learning and Data Engineering”. The tagline for Acceldata is ‘Data Lake Operations Optimised’ and I help the team/company do exactly that using tools of Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, etc.   I come from a Software Development background, and I can visualise all the nightmares that I or my colleagues have been through trying to productionize their code. People having worked in companies having periodic on-call activities might understand this even better.   If one closely watches the trend of how courses that teach Machine Learning are designed, it is easy to see one similar pattern across all of the courses. Developing everything using the Jupyter Notebooks. Though it is the best way to learn Data Science and Visualize the results, productinizing code is a different beast altogether. So, there is a clear gap when it comes to models in Notebooks vs models in Production. In this post, I would like to address this GAP and show how we at Acceldata productionize machine learning projects.   Note: A forecasting problem might not be a Machine Learning problem, but since we are learning the representation of several independent variables to one dependent variable and predicting the dependent variable, I will be brave and call it a Machine Learning (like) model.   Problem Statement      To forecast the resource usage for different queues in YARN.    To give you more information about this, the queues in YARN can be imagined to be similar to queues in Data Structures and used for the task of scheduling (read more here) of jobs, tasks. So, these queues are given a certain capacity which can be imagined to be the number of tasks, jobs that can be stored in it. The queue can be partitioned into multiple sub-queues. The queue has a property which is its ‘Used Capacity’ at a point in time. Our task is to forecast how much capacity of the queue will be used at some point in the future.      Using the above forecast, business users will be able to make informed decisions as to whether upscale or downscale their queues.    Let’s talk a bit about the components that we will discuss throughout the post and how they are interlinked and complete the puzzle i.e. ML to production.   Simple High Level (System) Design     Let’s start going through each of the components i.e. MongoDB, InfluxDB and then the ML pipeline in that order.   MongoDB  We use MongoDB to store log information of all the components that we support (check here) and also resource usage values for each of the queues in YARN. Now, to analyse and write predictive algorithms about this data, it is imperative that we import this data and then process it.   Below is a snapshot (skipped features and samples) of how the data looks like.                  _id       absMaxCapacity       numActiveApps       numPendingApps       vcoresTotal                       1       100       75       75       1071                 2       15.34       1       1       164                 3       28.57       31       31       306                 4       38.09       41       41       408                 5       18       2       2       193           Each of the rows above describe the status of a queue at a particular point in time.   InfluxDB  Now Most of the data that we collect at Acceldata is time-series based and it only makes sense to store it in a time series database. Since the predictions are time-series based i.e. the forecasts are timestamps in the future displaying the queue usage, all the predictions are written to InfluxDB. We acknowledge the fact that no one can be perfect. So along with the predictions, we make sure to predict the upper and lower bounds of the queue usage so as to give the business user a perspective of how much variance one can expect.   ML Pipeline     Clean and Preprocess the data and get it ready to pass to a time-series model.   Train the model and based on error criteria (discussed below), choose the best model   Forecast predictions, upper bound as well as lower bounds   Prepare data to write into InfluxDB A detailed explanation for each of the Machine Learning Steps involved is discussed later in this post.   Dashboard  Finally, time to see the results! A Data Science project is incomplete without visualisation. The predicted data that is pumped into InfluxDB is rendered to the UI and below is how the predictions look like.   The below images show 2 queues i.e. DEFAULT and LLAP which are sub-queues under root queue. The first image merges the actual queue usage and predicted queue usage for the current day. The second image is the predictions for the next day. The number of days to predict in the future is a configurable param that is present in the data model section.       Looking at the Machine Learning Pipeline in detail   This is the most important section and actually explains what the title promised. Let’s discuss what all are the parts when stitched together help us get a Machine Learning model to production.   Software Engineering   Software Engineering is an art of abstracting tech stuff so that even users who do not understand code can use it to get the results they desire. Below are some of the tasks that fall under the software engineering category and important to complete the pipeline.      Designing Database Access Layers also called DAO     Since we are dealing with multiple sources of data, we cannot expect the business user to specify how to query the sources for data. We expect them to specify where the data is located. Writing code to extract data from different sources lies in the hands of the Software Engineers that design the these systems   Web App layer to get details about the params for the Data Ingestion sources     The business users request data through this layer that stands as an interface between the Machine Learning models and them. For this to happen, a usual practice is to design an API or Data Model that can be exposed via a REST/web layer discussed in the above point   Data Engineering   There are blog posts that discuss how Data Engineers extracted data from different data sources and warehouses, and merged them and pushed to a SQL or NOSQL db or even CSV files so that the Data Scientists would be able to work seamlessly with the data. I will simplify it and discuss how I performed data engineering to get data into the Machine Learning models.      In most cases where devs are dealing with multiple data sources and various business users, the data engineering pipelines get complicated. Data storage and retrieval becomes a huge headache and choices of SQL vs NOSQL vs warehouses, Batch vs Stream processing, etc kick in design discussions about such cases are topics for another post.   For us fortunately (as of now), the data sources are InfluxDB and MongoDB only. Using the abstracted tools from the Software Engineering section, we can get this data in the format that is desired using various db clients. Most of the code for this is written in Python and most of API clients have a provision to get this data in the DataFrame format that is best suited for Machine Learning models.   Now that we have our data extracted and ready for Machine Learning model, let’s head into seeing what are the various parts in Machine Learning.   Machine Learning          Import Data   Once the data engineering (simply data ingestion) module is ready, data is imported, merged and mutated into a DataFrame which is easier to work with Data Science workflows. The ML module now has the queue data in DataFrames format.       Clean Data and Feature Engineering   As you might have heard more than a thousand times and almost every one discusses this as the most important aspect of Data Science, the current workflow also uses this aspect very well. Some of the techniques used are:            Cleaning Unwanted Columns                    highly correlated data (noisy data)           extra columns that may be passed by the data source                       Developing Useful Time Features                    day of the week/hour/month           week of the month/year           month/quarter of the year           holiday           whether weekend or not           proximity to weekend                       Normalising/Scaling Data   I have seen this data preparation technique improve results almost all the times. It is just easy for the model to comprehend data that fit in the same scale.       Sample Data   The data captured from Hadoop and other components and system metrics is too frequent (seconds) to be used directly for modelling and hence sampling into higher time measures is very important using aggregations like mean, median, min, max depending on the use-case. This way a lot of noise is excluded from entering the model.           Fit Data and Forecast            Now that we have the data ready to be run model on, we choose the train and test data and use multiple algorithms to see which one of the Algorithms, hyper-params and params give best results.       The best model is chosen and forecasts are then generated. Our models are based on Facebook’s Prophet, LSTM and VAR.           Prepare Data for writing results to DB   Data preparation is not only necessary to train the model. When we often write back data to some database, some design choices have to be made so that the end/business users can make appropriate use of the data. Tasks can be something like:            adding time as a field or even making it a primary key       writing data keeping in mind the indexes for the tables/documents/measurements       adding extra incremental fields in very rare cases that might be required by the charting libraries to render and display on the           This task is (mostly) closely related to Data Engineering but the current use-case is simple and hence to not complicate the task, I avoided separating from the ML module. But, it is absolutely recommended to separate it from the ML logic. There is a high probability that I might have actually implemented this by the time you stumble upon this post (:wink:).       Evaluation of the Models  Evaluation or Error Calculation is the measure that decides which model works better and should be chosen for forecasts on production data. Since dealing with absolute values, we have used MAPE as the error measure.   Data Model  This is where software engineering again comes into picture. The business users have better idea about the sampling, frequency and prediction periods (remember we mentioned earlier accepting information from business users). So, it makes sense to accept these kind of params from the users and prepare our data or run our models based on them. This can be highly debated but suited our use case. Below is a sample of the request payload.   {      \"job_name\":\"queue_usage_forecaster\",    \"job_description\":\"Get predictions for next 'k' days/hours/months\",    \"user_name\":\"Bob\",    \"project\":\"Capacity Forecasting\",    \"owner\":\"ui-service\",    \"data\":{         \"source\":{            \"name\":\"mongodb\",          \"document\":\"&lt;replace_with_apt_name&gt;\",          \"collection\":\"&lt;replace_with_apt_name&gt;\"       },       \"destination\":{            \"name\":\"influxdb\",          \"database\":\"&lt;replace_with_apt_name&gt;\",          \"measurement\":\"&lt;replace_with_apt_name&gt;\"       }    },    \"aggregation_time_period\":\"1h\",    \"data_ingestion_time_period\":\"5d\",    \"future_prediction_time_period\":\"3d\" }   This can be persisted in a db to keep an account of the usage but again for brevity I will skip discussing about it.   How to get going when going gets tough?   This section has got nothing to do with productionizing ML pipelines. These are some tips that can help you to get work done in case there is less help available.      The Rubber Duck Methodology     Read more about the technique here. However, in short, it just means to explain the problem and the solution to yourself and convince that this is correct. Remember that along with just completing a task, you are learning something that might come in handy in the future. So, try to grill yourself as much as you can to make sure what you are doing it right. However, do not fall into the trap of perfecting your work. There is a fine line between the two.   Read     There is clearly a lot of information available about how to productionize ML models. Read through engineering/data science blogs from good companies that do not shy away from sharing their experiences online. Read and reread to grasp the stuff and try to implement what suits your needs.   Write     There is a huge community out there on Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium where you can share your work and get suggestion/tips. However, do talk to your seniors to know if it is okay to share the content publicly before doing it. I have a green flag from my CEO to give you a perspective   End Notes  ","categories": [],

## What this Series is all about? Some Background?
I have been learning and doing Machine Learning for 2 years now. Most of my work and learning has been about:-
- How to clean data
- Use multiple algorithms and evaluation metrics and choose a better one that fits the needs
- Productionize it.

Check this [post](https://vikramriyer.github.io/machine-learning-at-acceldata/) I wrote about productionizing a ML project.

I have already completed a lot of hands-on courses and have learned a lot. Courses include:-
- Udacity
  - Machine Learning Nanodegree
  - Deep Learning Nanodegree
  - Data Engineering Nanodegree
  - Data Analyst Nanodegree
  - Self-Driving Car Nanodegree
- Udemy
  - Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization
  - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp
  - Machine Learning A-Z
  - Python and Django Full stack
  - Python and Flask Full stack
- Coursera
  - Deep Learning Specialization (3/5 completed courses)
  - Mathematics of Machine Learning (1.5/3 completed courses)
  - Machine Learning: University of Washington (Partially Completed)

I have leaned how to structure ML projects and how to use various algorithms and when to use which one the ones available. I have also learned various evaluation metrics and other nuances involved in machine learning. A Software Development background has helped me learn all of these things pretty fast. However, now I want to learn the math and understand research papers. So, after a lot of research I have come up with a plan to read through a few books and go through a few courses. They are stated below:

Courses:-
- Introduction to Machine Learning(IIT Madras)(Balaram Ravindran) [Website](onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc19_cs53/)
- Machine Learning (CMU)(Tom Mitchell) [Website](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/courses/601sp15/lectures.shtml)

Books:-
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1461471370/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0387848576/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman
- [Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.in/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/1259096955/) by Tom M. Mitchell
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.in/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/) by Christopher M. Bishop
- [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/9352134575/) by Andreas Muller
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/9352135210/) by AurÈlien GÈron

__Goal__: I am hoping that I will be able to summarise the aggregated knowledge from these books based on topics that I feel will be best separated into one post for better understanding and act a step by step guide to learn Machine Learning. This is mainly for my own satisfaction but I am hopeful that it will be beneficial to the readers.

__Frequency__: At present, I think one post per month would be my Goal. Only time will tell if this is underwhelming or overwhelming.

Below are the chapters in the learning series and each one hyperlinks to a post that covers the topic.

_Note_: The topics might change as I feel will best suit the reading experience and max benefit to readers and myself.

- Post 1: [An Introduction to Machine Learning (only Theory, no Code, but Interesting)](http://0.0.0.0:5689/Intro-to-ML/)
Summary: We cover various paradigms of Machine Learning and where each of them can be applied to real world problems.

I hope you find this series helpful and satisfying to read as I did feel writing it. Wow, it was so much pleasure. (I actually wrote this line on my first day planning the series :wink:)

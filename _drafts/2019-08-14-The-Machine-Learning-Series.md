# The Data Science Lifecycle
In this series of posts, I will go through what productionizing data science might look like.

## What will this post and the successive ones cover?
- Problem statement and the Data
- Project requirements and freezing features for v1
- Data collection, Web Scraping
- Data Wrangling and Cleaning
- Running first models on experimental setup (Jupyter Notebooks?)
- Think Production: Software architecture, Tools, Design
- Deployment
- Evaluation
- Scheduling, Async

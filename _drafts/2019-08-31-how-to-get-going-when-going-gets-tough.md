## How to get going when going gets tough?

These are some tips that can help you to get work done in case there is less help available.

1. The Rubber Duck Methodology <br>
  Read more about the [technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) here. However, in short, it just means to explain the problem and the solution to yourself and convince that this is correct. Remember that along with just completing a task, you are learning something that might come in handy in the future. So, try to grill yourself as much as you can to make sure what you are doing it right. However, do not fall into the trap of perfecting your work. There is a fine line between the two.
2. Read <br>
  There is clearly a lot of information available about how to productionize ML models. Read through engineering/data science blogs from good companies that do not shy away from sharing their experiences online. Read and reread to grasp the stuff and try to implement what suits your needs.
3. Write <br>
  There is a huge community out there on Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium where you can share your work and get suggestion/tips. However, do talk to your seniors to know if it is okay to share the content publicly before doing it. I have a green flag from my CEO to give you a perspective.

## What does the field of Machine Learning want?
Whether there are ways in which the Machines, or in simple terms computer programs can be made to learn with experience.
So, let's break it down or make it simpler.
I have a computer program and I perform some file input/output or reading from the command like or work on some web api's. I want the program to learn some stuff as it experiences something every damn time it runs.
To give you an analogy, <replace with an example here>

Let's go through what learning is in the context of Machine Learning. <br>
Application 1 <br>
You go to a doctor and the doctor checks you with some tools that he has. He is able to tell you what your problem is. He writes some medicines for you and gives you a prescription.

Application 2 <br>
Students copy the assignments from fellow students and it is a tedious job for the professors to distinguish the copied ones from the original. The professor can write Machine Learning algorithms to find if a similar assignement is already present and by clustering the similar assignments, teachers can figure out which of the students be given extra assignments. Though this initially feels like a dangerous application, students can beat this algorithm by developing counter algorithms that can fool the application that the professors wrote by making fake copies of the assignments that actually look real.

## The Machine Learning Process
Let's pick the assignment example from above to understand what the Machine Learning process might be from the professors and the students point of view.

#### Professor's learning algorithm to find the copied ones
What is the task that the professor's algorithm has at hand?
What is the learning experience for the algorithm?
What is the measure of the performance to make sure the professor doesn't miss out the copied ones?

#### Student's learning algorithm to fool the professor's algorithm

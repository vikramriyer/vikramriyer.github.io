In a series of posts, I will try to summarise and build upon my learnings from [Fast NLP course](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) taught by
[Racheal Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel) in 2019.

Below is the index of the lessons in the course
1. [What is NLP?](#what-is-nlp?)
2. ___[Topic Modelling with with SVD and NMF](https://vikramriyer.github.io/Topic-Modelling-and-SVD-and-NMF/)___ (this post)
3. [Topic Modelling and SVD revisited](https://vikramriyer.github.io/Topic-Modelling-and-SVD-revisited/)
4. [Sentiment Classification with Naive Bayes](https://vikramriyer.github.io/Sentiment-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes/)
5. [Sentiment Classification with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression ctd..](https://vikramriyer.github.io/Sentiment-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-and-Logistic-Regression-ctd../)

## What is Topic Modelling?
You have a collection of text/documents.
You can represent them in following ways:
- Count of words as bag of words
-  

## Matrix Factorization
Factorization is a technique by which we break the matrix in smaller ones. Now, the simple reason is that it is easy to work with smaller matrices or even numbers for that matter.  Additional benefit is that these smaller matrices have some unique properties and usefulness.

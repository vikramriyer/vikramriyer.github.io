## How to read books?
There has a been a lot of discussion about how books improve ones understanding of the world and how it helps grow in the materialistic world. Without voicing my support or going against the popular beliefs, I will add a few opinions of my own on this topic.

1. I started reading random books about self-help or self-improvement and surprisingly psychology, never really had a thing for fiction and fantasy.
2. When I quit my salaried job to spend some time understanding what I wanted to do for the next 5-10 years, I decided I needed to read the technical books related to Data Science and some Software Engineering books out of curiosity and books narrating founder/startup stories.
3. After doing some research internship in Machine Learning and joining an early stage startup, I started reading about Economics, Geo-politics, Investing, Critical Thinking, Mental Models, etc.
4. Now, I have recently found my interest for Philosophy and rekindled my liking for Psychology.

So, the point of the above statements is this, "Just keep reading what ever you like and worry less about extracting every bit of information from everything you read". I suggest that instead of looking for the best books to read to become successful, just pick book on the topics that you are interested in and keep reading and either broadening or narrowing down based on where in the career you are placed. It is an inward decision rather than an outward one and worry less about having read a complete book. Anyways one is not going to remember everything they read. Of all the below books I have read, I might have probably re-read at most 5 books that I liked the most. And frankly, those are the books that I might read again. Cheers and have a happy reading journey!

> Pro-tip: Read on kindle, it helps you highlight the parts you enjoyed and export them if you'd like to skim through them. If you like the book after reading, buy a physical copy to show-off. I like to see my library everyday. ;)

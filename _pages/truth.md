Truth is mostly disappointing. After reading many books, blogs, etc; listening to a lot of smart people speak, I have understood one thing. "There is not secret recipe to achieving anything in this world. "

To explain further let me give examples based on people from different aspects of life that I admire

### Successful Business People
People who run successful businesses will say,
- Work hard and in time learn to work smart and that gives you an advantage
- Out work and out smart your competition
- Timing of your business is very important, but more so is execution

### Successful Investors
- Take rational decisions when others are being emotional and stupid
- Calculate probabilities and avoid biases
- As important as it is to calculate what will happen when we take a decision, equally important is to calculate what will happen if we don't

### Successful Scientists and Academic People
- Take one step at a time but keep the bigger picture in mind
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you and are equally smart or better

There are many such people who have the same things to say which is IMO the truth. It is ones expectation that disappoints him/her when they hear the truth.

People expect trick and tips and short-cuts and magic formulae, etc which do not exist.

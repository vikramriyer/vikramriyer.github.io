Hiya! I am Vikram, a Technologist (read: Software Engineer) well versed in the Data and ML space. I can talk about Software, being kind, unbiased, thoughtful, lifting weights, etc.

Books are a huge part of my life and so, here is the [list](/books/) of books I am reading or have already read. 

I enjoy talking to people and discussing biases, performance, tricking the mind, developing habits (mostly good), and fallacies.

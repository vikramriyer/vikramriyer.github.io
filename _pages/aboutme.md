I am a Machine Learning Engineer and I like building (understanding) businesses, products and try my best to find ways to solve them using tech and data science; have failed at a doing so quite a few times but gained a lot of experience listening to people. I have a strong development background which has (I believe) helped me pivot into Data Science and engineer solutions with ease. I have listed a few of my learning projects [here](/projects/). I worked on these when learning Data Science.

Here is the [list](/books/) of books I am reading or already read. I also reread a lot of them.

Working out and meditating help me maintain my sanity in personal life and insanity in working hard!

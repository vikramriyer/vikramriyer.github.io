Hiya! I am Vikram, a Technologist (read: Software Engineer) well versed in the Data and ML space. 

Books are a huge part of my life and so, here is the [list](/books/) of books I've read or am reading. 

I also like writing and do share thoughts in [this space](/writing/). 

Apart from technology; I enjoy talking to people about biases, tricking the mind, being kind and the list goes on. 

In a past life, I was introduced to mentoring by Udacity and loved doing it and it was great while it lasted, see more [here](/mentoring/).

I like understanding business, product problems and try my best to find ways to solve them using tech and data science. By profession, I am a Machine Learning Engineer well versed specifically in Supervised Learning. I love probability and am always amazed by its uses across domains. It has improved my life in so many ways for good, made me calculate before speaking, made me humble. I had a strong development background before I pivoted into Data Science and hence can convert Data Science experiments and hypothesis to production ready systems. I have listed a few of my learning projects [here](/projects/). I worked on this when learning Data Science. I am secretly writing a book on doing Data Science the right way keeping all tech components into mind. If I do not release it by 2020 end, you can give me shout out at LinkedIn or Twitter, that will keep me accountable. :)

I read books like my life depended on them. You can find a [list here](/books/). I also reread a lot of them.

Working out and meditating help me maintain my sanity in personal life and insanity for working hard!

A Machine Learning Engineer well versed specifically in Supervised Learning. I love probability and am amazed by its uses across domains. I have a strong development background before pivoting into Data Science and hence can convert Data Science experiments to production ready systems.

I read books like my life depended on them. You can find a [list here](/books/). I also reread a lot of them.

I also like lifting heavy. :)
- Deadlift 1RM = 190 kgs
- Squat 1RM = 120 kgs
- Benchpress 1RM = 90 kgs

I meditate as well, not aiming to get some magical benefits, but to improve my focus. Let me know if you need help with this.

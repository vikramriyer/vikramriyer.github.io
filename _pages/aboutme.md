I am a Senior Software Engineer well versed in the Data and ML space. I have a strong development background which has (I believe) helped me pivot into Data Science and engineer solutions with ease. I have listed a few of my learning projects [here](/projects/) however the list might not be updated.

Currently, I work at a Data Observability company and enjoy building ML solutions for Data Quality problems. 
 
Here is the [list](/books/) of books I am reading or have already read. I mostly end up rereading parts of the same books. I also buy more than I can read because my budget allows me to. :)

Big time workout nerd for the body and meditator for the mind. I enjoy talking to people and discussing biases and fallacies. Hit me up if you are into these things as well. I'd love to talk.

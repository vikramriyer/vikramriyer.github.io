I am a Senior Software Engineer well versed in the Data and ML space. I like writing Software, talking Psychology, building products, talking Tech, etc.
Currently, I work at a Data Observability startup and enjoy building ML solutions for Data Quality, Observability problems.

Here is the [list](/books/) of books I am reading or have already read. I mostly end up rereading parts of the same books. I also buy more than I can read because why not!

Big time workout geek (body and mind). I enjoy talking to people and discussing biases, performance, tricking the mind, developing habits (mostly good), and fallacies. Hit me up if you are into these things as well. I'd love to talk.

If I were not a Software Engineer, I would have taken up Psychology or Neuroscience. Also, never say never.

Like you, I have a lot of questions. So, the first thing we did before the internet was to ask our parents. Then, our friends, probably our relatives, teachers, etc. Then once the internet arrived, we google. Read and consume content.

All of this has led me to always seek different perspectives. Diversify the portfolio of the content you seek (read, listen, watch). One day you might be seeking content about how to learn to code, while the other day you might be reading about the epidemics and how vaccines are important. You might be reading a book on how geopolitics influences wars and makes or breaks economies and then you also watch productivity lessons.

An important question is, how do you validate what you are consuming is correct and is not misguided information. There are many answers like seeking out help from people you believe are true, nice, empathetic, have high emotional quotient, and so on. But, in my opinion, the answer is this conviction comes with experience. You believe in something, talk about how you know some awesome thing only to find after a few years that all of that was pure BS. It is embarrassing but you learn some patterns.

So, to sum up, consume varied content and have strong opinions about it. Also be ready to face embarrassment when your opinions are crushed. Most importantly, learn from them, improve, and when you share what you know, be as correct as you can.

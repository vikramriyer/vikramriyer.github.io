### Short Story
Seek different perspectives on matters that concern you and your well being. Career, Business, Life, etc.

### Long Story
Like you, I had a lot of questions. I had questions about anything and everything. From science to astronomy to everyday life and so on. So naturally, I asked these questions to family, friends, relatives, teachers, etc. After the dawn of the internet, I started googling. Read and consumed a lot of content. Some got it right, some got it wrong but that made to talk to a varied set of people. It made a lot of sense, common sense.

All of this led me to always seek different perspectives, to diversify the portfolio of the content I sought (read, listen, watch). One day I might be seeking content about how to learn to code, while the other day I might be reading about the epidemics and how vaccines are important. I might be reading a book on how geopolitics influences wars and makes or breaks economies and then I also watched productivity lessons on YouTube. My favorite [books](/books) collection displays a glimpse of the variety.

Where am I getting with all this? I am getting to an important question which is, "How do people validate whether the content they are consuming is correct and is not misguided information." There are many answers, like, seeking out help from people you believe are true, nice, empathetic, successful (whatever that means), have high emotional quotient, and so on. But, IMO, the answer is this conviction comes with experience. At some point in time, one might find something unbelievably awesome only to know after some time that all of that was pure BS. It is embarrassing but we learn some patterns, not everything is lost. The pattern might be something like, "This felt too good to be true, I had a strange doubt about it's working, It was so stupid of me think this was awesome, etc." What we lacked was thinking through multiple lenses or simply asking some other people their opinions. That would have lowered the probability of disappointment/embarrassment.

So, to sum up, consume varied content and have strong opinions about it. Also be ready to face embarrassment when your opinions are crushed. Most importantly, learn from them, improve, and when you share what you know, be as correct as you can, because some other person might learn from what you learned.

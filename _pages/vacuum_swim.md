title: Swimming in Vacuum

### Premise/Background
So, the vacuum feels so light and we float by default and that is so awesome. Ask a newbie swimmer how difficult it is to stay afloat. If the vacuum provides this facity out of the box, why can't we swim?

### What I found out
Well, what does swimming actually involve? We push water back and as a result propel forward. In vacuum, there is nothing to push against, so no displacement and hence no swimming. 

### What triggers me next?
- If the vacuum has nothing, how are astronauts alive at a space station?
- Is the outer space actually a vacuum? Is there nothing out there?

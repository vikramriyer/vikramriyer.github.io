I think, we humans, try to immediately conclude. I started with we humans, but am going to continue with my personal experience, otherwise I might end up grossly underestimating or overestimating.

As a child, I believed in God, Ghosts, and all all things super natural. The reason I did this, I think, is because I wanted to know the answer. The way I was brought up, it was wrong to not know the answer. It was not ok to not score well in examinations, not ok to be left behind in anything. For competitions sake, it might be fair to do this but this probably not good when it comes to learning; which happens life long. Just to clarify, I was not harassed or anything but I felt uncomfortable asking questions and saying, "I don't know." I rarely heard people say they didn't know so I assumed that we had to know.

Now, the (COVID) pandemic, obviously gave birth to a lot of pseudoscience, or probably the pseudoscience already existed and COVID just amplified the reach. Fortunately, over the years, I listened to quite a few smart people talk, read as many books as possible, in short sought different [perspectives](/perspectives). When I started thinking about why people believe in all kinds of shitty pseudoscience, I realised that they are too paranoid to not know things how a certain thing works/happens. I was that person when I was young. So, as a result, they believe in the thing that feels intellectually right to them. I once heard someone say that humans do not like uncertainties, I don't remember who said this but I too believe that. We, like to conclude things as soon as we can.

Here is an example to concretise what I mean. I will give a few examples below and expect you to find a pattern.

[2, 4], [5, 25], [11, 121]

Can you find a pattern?

__Group 1__: Some might guess that one number is a the square of another and conclude.

__Group 2__: Some might want to be absolutely sure and ask a few more examples.

Let's say, I add 1 more example.

[13, 169]

I am pretty sure the Group 1 group is pretty happy and they would say something like, "I told you!".

__Group 2__: They are happy too and conclude it is square of numbers.

__Group 3__: Some might notice that these are indeed squares but of prime numbers.

Concluding early might not be that great I guess? A better thing to do would have been to say, "I don't know (yet)." Ask more questions and try to find out.

Let me surprise you, "The pattern I was actually thinking off was squares of prime numbers below 15!!! " How could you have been (possibly) right?

__By trying to DISPROVE our assumption/conclusion__ instead of trying to prove what we have already believed to be true. A subset of this way of thinking is also called __confirmation bias__. To explain further, we could have asked for more examples or come up with some more questions disproving what we believed. For example, does [20, 400] fall in your pattern?

But, here comes yet another surprise, what if we can never understand what the pattern is? For example, it's not squares of prime numbers less than 15, what about less than 100, 1000, etc?

This is where we should try to seek but be ok when we cannot find answers. Remember that scientists and other great people spent their lives trying to work on something they believed but did not conclude when they got the first chance. Obviously some got the solutions at a younger age but most had to dedicate their life to finding out. Unfortunately, we do not hear about he ones who did not succeed and celebrate only the ones who did succeed. It is fine to sometimes not know and say, "I don't know and keep searching. " It is probably bad, however, to prematurely conclude something. I have learned to be __not afraid of not knowing__. I encourage you too.

Peace!

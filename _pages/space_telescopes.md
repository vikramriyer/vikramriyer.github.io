### Premise/Background
So, the hubble telescope completes a revolution around the earth every ~96 minutes, which in short means, it's fast. Now, isn't it better to use earth mounted firm telescopes to see stuff rather than using it as a satellite to view distant celestial objects?

### What I found out
Turns out, the main reason is that we need to get out of the earth's atmosphere to get a clearer view of these objects. Imagine wanting to see the full moon on a cloudy day, the clouds block your view. The atmosphere allows only some light to enter earth.

Now, what does light entering earth have to do with telescopes, you ask?
Actually, our eyes work this way. Light is reflected from an object and enters our eye. You can read the anatomy of the eye if you need more details. :) Similarly, light from these celestial objects reaches our eyes via the telescope!

Now, let me confuse OR curios-ify you! Telescopes can also see things that have happened in the past. ;)

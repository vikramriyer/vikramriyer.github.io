I was scared of going wrong, so played safe and ended up going wrong anyways. In this post, I will try my best to share a naive idea of what seems like a good framework to learn better and succeed.

- Reformulate and restate until it makes complete sense
- Be okay with the AWKWARD SILENCE
- When you once listen to someone smart talk, follow the below steps
  - pause and imagine yourself in their place
  - before listening to them, imagine and think how you would answer the question
  - write the answer down, literally work by word
  - unpause and listen to their answer
  - pause and check whether you did better or worse (this is subjective, make the best judgement that is going to help you)
  - Finally, for me at least, this process took a lot of time and after a certain point in time, I started getting better. So give it some time and things will get better

# Deep Learning
[Teach A Car To Drive Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Teach_A_Car_To_Drive_Using_Deep_Learning) <br>
_In this project, we will use a deep neural network to teach itself to drive by watching us drive. This tasks is also referred to as behavioural cloning._

[German Traffic Sign Classifier using Keras](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Keras_Deep_Learning) <br>
_Using Keras and slight modifications to LeNet, we will create a classifier that can classify between different traffic signs._

# Computer Vision for Self Driving Cars
[Finding Lane Lines Using Advanced Computer Vision](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Drive_A_Car_Using_Advanced_Computer_Vision) <br>
_In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video using Gradient Color Spaces and some Perspective Transforms._

[Finding Lane Lines Using Basic Computer Vision](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Drive_A_Car_Using_Basic_Computer_Vision) <br>
_In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video using Edge Detections and Hough Transforms and some Extrapolation techniques._

# Traditional Machine Learning
[Spam (binary) classification using Machine Learning](https://github.com/vikramriyer/enron_email_fraud) <br>
_The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse. Our aim is to predict whether a given person is s person of interest, by using machine learning models._

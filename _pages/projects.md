# Deep Learning
[Teach A Car To Drive Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Teach_A_Car_To_Drive_Using_Deep_Learning) <br>
_In this project, we will use a deep neural network to teach itself to drive by watching us drive. This tasks is also referred to as behavioural cloning._

[German Traffic Sign Classifier using Keras](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Keras_Deep_Learning) <br>
_Using Keras and slight modifications to LeNet, we will create a classifier that can classify between different traffic signs._

[Neural Network from Scratch using Numpy](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Neural_Network_from_Scratch_Numpy) <br>
_Implementing a 2 layered neural network from scratch using numpy. We will use the Bike Share dataset from UCLI repository to solve a regression problem and test out neural network._

# Computer Vision for Self Driving Cars
[Finding Lane Lines Using Advanced Computer Vision](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Drive_A_Car_Using_Advanced_Computer_Vision) <br>
_In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video using Gradient Color Spaces and some Perspective Transforms._

[Finding Lane Lines Using Basic Computer Vision](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Drive_A_Car_Using_Basic_Computer_Vision) <br>
_In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video using Edge Detections and Hough Transforms and some Extrapolation techniques._

# Traditional Machine Learning
[Spam (binary) classification using Machine Learning](https://github.com/vikramriyer/enron_email_fraud) <br>
_The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse. Our aim is to predict whether a given person is s person of interest, by using machine learning models._

# Data Analysis
[Exploratory Analysis using R](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_with_R) <br>
_Exploratory Data Analysis is an immensely powerful way to visualize data and head in the correct direction to make insights out of it. We will look at different ways in which data can be analyzed before its taken forward for prediction with various algorithms._

[Data Wrangling of OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Data_Wrangling_Cleaning_of_OpenStreetMap_using_MySQL) <br>
_By using the data obtained from open street map, we will first clean it for some obvious errors and then dump into a mysql database to draw meaningful insights about people in a particular city; Pune, India._

[A/B Testing for Ecommerce website](https://github.com/vikramriyer/Analyze-AB-test-Results/blob/master/README.md) <br>
_E-Commerce Website A/B testing: Recommend which of two landing pages to keep based on A/B testing to determine user engagement._

# Personal Projects _(for daily productivity)_
[Dev Dashboard](https://github.com/vikramriyer/github-dash) (in progress..)<br>
_This is a personal project that I intend to share with the dev (software devs, data scientists, etc) community so that they can have a single dashboard to check the repositories and users they want to track from multiple sources (Github, Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn). It can act as a single dashboard where a user can get information about all the devs/influencers on one page. Anyone who wishes to collaborate can absolutely reach me out at twitter [@vikramriyer](https://twitter.com/vikramriyer)._

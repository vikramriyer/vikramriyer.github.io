These are my learnings and opinions on topics I like to discuss. Reach out to me if you want to discuss it in detail. I like talking to people and learning from them. Don't we all? These short essays have helped me shape my life in some way or the other.

How does writing help me?
- I might have had an opinion at some point in life about something, the next time I try to write about it, I might see the delta and learn what changed and why it did. IMO, this is highly useful.
- For fun, this is like my own book of learning philosophy.
- Also helps me keep myself accountable about the things I say/share. I have promised myself to not delete old stuff just because it looks funny, embarrassing, goofy. :)

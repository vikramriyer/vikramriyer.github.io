These are my learnings and opinions on topics I like to discuss. Reach out to me if you want to talk. I like talking to people and learning from them. Don't we all? These short essays have helped me shape my life in some way or the other.

The essays I discuss here might or might not be actual science and are my personal thoughts or philosophies. Stating this because, unfortunately, however hard we try, we are always prone to make assumptions that might feel convincing but might be not. I try hard to not do that but can't help it always.

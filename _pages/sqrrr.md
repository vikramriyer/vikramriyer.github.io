### What is the SQ3R (SQRRR) methodology?
Survey -> Question -> Read -> Recite -> Review.

#### Survey
So, we survey the chapter first, to know what all things to expect from it. This helps us look at the topics that will be the main points in the chapter.
Something in our brain tries remembering it and then, later when we actually read the contents, this helps.

#### Question
Read the questions at the end of the chapter.

#### Read
Now, read through each part in the chapter and make notes.

#### Recite (recall)
Now, just by looking at the headings, try remembering what you noted down or read them.

#### Review
Review how well you remembered what you read, made notes about.

### Concluding Remarks
Even after following this method, I am not remember everything. I think it is fine. I still find this helpful when reading books.

This page has some fascination details about ideas in everyday science or some common science terms. I keep revisiting this page to feel like a child.

## Temperature
Temperature is the degrees to which an entity is heater or cooled.

It is the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the environment (room, auditorium, body, etc ).

So, when we pump in gas in the vehicle tube, we are exerting some energy and hence the temperature of the gas inside the tube will be higher than that of the outside surrounding.
There is a certain atmospheric pressure until which it is easier to pump in air, once that threshold is reached, it becomes increasingly difficult to pump in air. This is because the gas inside the tube resists being compressed further. When we pump in air, we are actually compressing it to fit inside the tube i.e. we pump in more than what can fit inside the tube and hence there is compression of air. So cool right?

## Lightyear
Is a light year a time measure or a distance measure?

Where is it used? How is it used?

Can we measure our distance from the Sun and Moon in light years?
